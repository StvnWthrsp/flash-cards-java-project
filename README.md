# flash-cards-java-project
Final project for high school Java course. Basic flash cards program, uses Swing for GUI elements.

All of the code is in one single .java file. This was one of my first ever solo projects, and is very beginner. I may likely rewrite this program in the future to actually be more efficient and useful.
